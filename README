This is library "rsMPI" under development by Xiaolong Cui at the University of Pittsburgh.
rsMPI is a library for fault-tolerant Message Passing Interface (MPI) that exploits the Rejuvenating Shadows computational model.

This implementation is MPI-1.0 compatible. It supports blocking/non-blocking point-to-point communication, 
collective communication, communicator and group management, wildcard receive, and topology. For fault tolerance, it supports the 
re-juvenation after non-crash failures, shadow collocation, and shadow leaping features of Rejuvenating Shadows.
Existing and fixed bugs are reporeted in ./bugs.

User-level in-memory Checkpointing is simulated using the same technique as that used in shadow leaping. Each 
process has a "buddy" that stores a copy of the process' state in its memory, and the state is transferred from a 
process to its buddy using MPI messages. Please see directorey ./checkpoint for more implementation details. 

Prerequirements
==================================================================================================
1. RDMA socket library (rsocket)
2. MPI library

Compile 
==================================================================================================
To compile the rsMPI library:
1. cd rsMPI
2. mkdir obj
3. mkdir lib
4. cd ./src
5. make

Shared object files for rsMPI will be generated and stored in ./lib
Then you can compile your MPI application and link it to the rsMPI library.
6. mpicc -L/path/to/rsMPI -lrsmpi -lmpi ...

Run
==================================================================================================
Remember to set $LD_LIBRARY_PATH before running your application
1. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/rsMPI:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Generate a rankfile to contro process mapping and collocation, and use the provided configuration 
file to specify the collocation ratio at run time. 
Then you can launch your application code as usual, e.g., use mpirun
2. mpirun -np .. -rf rankfile ...
