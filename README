This is library "lsMPI" under development by Xiaolong Cui at the University of Pittsburgh.
lsMPI is a library for fault-tolerant  MPI that exploits the Lazy Shadowing computational model.

The most current version of lsMPI is under the directory of ./reboot/. It supports both point-to-point communication 
and collective communication, communicator and group management, wildcard receive. It supports re-juvenation after 
non-crash failures, shadow collocation, and shadow leaping features of Lazy Shadowing.

User-level in-memory Checkpointing is simulated using the same technique as that used in shadow leaping. Each 
process has a "buddy" that stores a copy of the process' state in its memory, and the state is transferred from a 
process to its buddy using MPI messages. Please see directorey ./checkpoint for more implementation details.
